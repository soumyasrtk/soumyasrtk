### Hi there 👋
I am Soumya Sanjay Kumar, a final year master's student studying physics at IISER Bhopal. My research interests lie in the field of quantum dynamics and quantum computing. New to GitHub, you'll mostly find codes in which I'm tinkering with some new concepts, trying to get a feel for the topic :P The idea is to get used to using Github as I explore topics with the help of numerical simulations.

<!-- 
**soumyasrtk/soumyasrtk** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
 -->
 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my master's thesis project which involves studying transport dynamics in a single-site quantum dot model attached to fermionic leads.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me a mail at soumya17@iiserb.ac.in or soumyasrtk@gmail.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ☕📚 My non-academic pursuits include learing to be a coffee connoisseur while I devour novels (mostly fiction) 🤓
- ⚡ Fun fact #1: If you're looking to reduce your caffeine intake by switching to green tea, don't. Deepending on the brewing conditions, steeping time, etc, a cup of green tea can have up to 75 mg of caffeine. 🍵
- ⚡ Fun fact #2: _Watchmen_ is the only graphic novel to appear on _Time_'s 2005 "All-Time 100 Greatest Novels" list. One of my favourite books, I highly recommend reading it atleast once.
